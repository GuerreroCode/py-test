-----------SETUP----------
python version: 2.6
to run filesystem.py, type "python filesystem.py"
some installs of python are called differently, for example it may be "py" or "./python" instead

----------COMMANDS---------

ls - lists all files and sub directories

mkdir [directory name] - makes a new directory

cd [directory name] - changes directory to listed directory
  -NOTE: changing directories is only supported from the current working directory
  -Changing directories from root, such as "cd home/sub1/sub2" is not supported

touch [file names] - creates a list of files based on their names

----------GETTING STARTED------
after running the filesystem program, a home directory will be created.
With nothing inside the home directory, it is up to you to make directories and files to then navigate them
Have fun!
